            "In many ways, the language is popular due to the development of the web. After all, it monopolized the browser and is, with rare exceptions, the only language capable of creating animations and validating forms, implementing almost any complex logic on the client side (in the browser).",
            "The modern web is not just simple websites and online stores from the 2000s, but mostly complex and interesting web applications. In addition to client-side logic, JavaScript is also popular on the server. And its popularity there is growing year by year. Furthermore, JavaScript allows you to write mobile applications and even ventures a bit into desktop applications.\nIn short, it's one language with many possibilities."
